If you are on an M1 chip MacBook, please consult the [M1 Version]; if you are on Linux, please consult my [Linux Version]; if you are unsure, please consult my [Guide to Determining Your Environment]._

## Overview

This guide covers the core technologies your computer will need for a **powerful** software engineering and web dev environment. The guide includes "detail" drop-downs like the following:

<details><summary>Click Me!</summary><br>

I will use these dropdowns to keep the guide relatively clean and focused on installation steps, but to still include important context about what is happening with each download, and important notes on possible errors. If you find yourself curious about what is actually happening, or have an error that you can't get around, just check them out!

### Some Tips Before You Start

Finally, before you start, I heavily recommend three things:

1. First, and most importantly, you **must** use methodical, step-by-step attention to detail. This will be integral to a career in software engineering, but especially when it comes to setting up your environment, **doing these steps out of order can have long-lasting, code-breaking implications**.
2. Second, if you're _brand_ new to engineering or aren't very comfortable with your computer, please review the [Guide to Unix Tools of the Trade]. Even for experienced engineers, **focusing on these more basic tools can significantly level up one's coding prowess and productivity**.
3. Third, open the [Glossary] in a new tab so you can reference it at any time. If you are unsure of any words used in this repository, just hop over and look it up.

Let's dive in!
