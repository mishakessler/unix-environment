## OVERVIEW

This guide covers the core technologies your computer will need for a software engineering and web dev environment. Briefly let's overview all of the installations:

- Your Terminal Toolbox ([Command Line Tools]);
- Your Primary Package Manager ([Homebrew]);
- Your Terminal Shell ([Zsh] and the [Oh My Zsh] framework);
- Your Version Control Manager ([Git] and the necessary [Git Configurations]);
- Your Frontend Scripting Language ([Node.js], as well as the version manager, [NVM], and the package manager, [NPM]);
- Your Database Management Programs ([PostgreSQL] and [MongoDB]);
- Your Backend Scripting Language ([Ruby], as well as the version manager, [Rbenv], and some packages, [Ruby Gems]); and
- Your GUI Applications.

In addition to these installations, I'll also be providing some customizations that will help you make the most of your coding environment, including:

- Your macOS Environment ([macOS Plugins]);
- Your Shell Environment ([Terminal Settings], [Zsh Plugins], and [Oh My Zsh Themes]);
- Your Integrated Development Environment ([VSCode Settings], [VSCode Extensions], and [VSCode Themes]); and finally,
- Your Browser Environment ([Google Chrome Extensions]).

<br>

Lastly, I'm including "detail" drop-downs like the following:

<details><summary>Click Me!</summary><br>

I will use these dropdowns to keep the guide relatively clean and focused, but to still include important details and context about what is happening with each download; I've used this **emoji key** to help with visual indicators:

- **üìã Installation Steps** ‚Äì¬†Self-explanatory.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning** ‚Äì¬†Warnings to avoid common mistakes.
- **‚ùó Common Errors** ‚Äì¬†Common errors and how to resolve them.
- **üîé Learn More** ‚Äì¬†More information on the software and its purpose.

</details><br>

### Some Tips Before You Start

Before you start, I recommend three things:

<details><summary>1) Familiarize Yourself With The Tools of the Trade</summary><br>

If you're _brand_ new to software engineering, or if you aren't particularly comfortable with your computer, including the command line interface, please review the guide to [Tools of the Trade]. Even for experienced engineers, focusing on these more basic tools can **significantly level up one's coding prowess and productivity**.

</details>

<details><summary>2) Practice Researching Anything & Everything</summary><br>

With the vast complexities of software engineering, it is simply impossible to know and memorize **everything** you will need on a daily basis. Get used to researching and confirming small details that will make a huge differences.

In this spirit, I've included links to documentation on all the software you'll need, and you can open up the [Glossary] in a new tab; if you have any questions or need to troubleshoot, use these to your advantage.

</details>

<details><summary>3) Be Thorough & Methodical</summary><br>

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you **must** use methodical, step-by-step attention to detail. This is integral to a career in software engineering, but especially when setting up your environment, **doing these steps out of order can have long-lasting, code-breaking implications**.

</details><br>

Let's dive in!

## INSTALLATIONS

This guide will be using **terminal** for all installations. One quick warning:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While installing, do not use the `sudo` command, unless specifically told to do so. `sudo`, meaning "Super User DO", will often install software in different file/folder locations on your hard drive. This can cause issues in the future.

Ready to get started? Let's open your terminal!

### Your Terminal Toolbox

#### Command Line Tools<!-- omit in toc -->

> [Xcode Documentation] | [Xcode Resources] | [Command Line Tools Downloads] 

Xcode is Apple's native Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. We won't be using Xcode, but we _will_ be using a subset of the Xcode app, called the _Command Line Tools_ package.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have the full Xcode suite installed already, skip to the Verify Installation steps.

<details><summary>üìã View Installation Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Copy and paste the following script into your terminal.

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

**STEP 2.** Follow the UI prompt to install the Command Line Tools. While installing, the prompt will show you a status bar and the approximate time remaining.

If successfully installed, the prompt will tell you, "The software was installed." Click "Done".

</details>

<details><summary>‚úÖ Verify Installation</summary><br>

To confirm installation, run the command `xcode-select -v`. The output should state `xcode-select version 2384` or higher.

To confirm installation location, run the command `xcode-select -p`. The output should state `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.

</details>

<details><summary>‚ùó Common Errors</summary><br>

If Command Line Tools are already installed, you will receive `xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates`.

If Command Line Tools is installed at the wrong path, this may be intentional; if you have the full Xcode suite, the output should state `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`; if not, simply try running the following command to reset the path location.

```shell
xcode-select -r
```

</details>

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>

At over 12GB, Xcode is a beast of an IDE, and we just don't need to use up that disk space. Instead, we'll use Command Line Tools, which is a smaller package within Xcode. Command Line Tools includes the most commonly used utilities and compilers (_make_, _GNU compiler collection_, _perl_, _git_, etc.), and we will be needing these. In Terminal, Command Line Tools uses `xcode-select` command prefix.

### Your Primary Package Manager

#### Homebrew<!-- omit in toc -->

> [Brew Documentation] | [Brew GitHub] | [Brew Issue Tickets]

Homebrew is a _package manager_ for macOS. Most core software you will need for the Unix dev environment is installed via Homebrew.

<details><summary>üìã Installation Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Copy and paste the following script into your terminal.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**STEP 2.** You should be prompted with `==> Checking for 'sudo' access (which may request your password).` You'll see a new line with a blinking key icon. Enter your Admin password.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è As you type, your cursor will not move and your typing won't be visible‚Äì¬†simply type your full password and hit enter.

**STEP 3.** Next, you should be prompted with `==> This script will install: ...` and `==> The following new directories will be created: ...`, listing a series of file-folder paths, followed by `Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort`. Press RETURN.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While Homebrew is still installing, you won't be able to use your bash command line prompt. You should see multiple processes running.

If successfully installed, you will see a large message that begins with `==> Installation successful!`.

**STEP 4.** While Homebrew is now installed, we now have to instruct our terminal to acknowledge `brew` commands. We do this by configuring our shell with a PATH update. Copy and paste the following script, then update the `[username]` to your Admin username, into your terminal.

```shell
echo >> /Users/[username]/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/[username]/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

</details>

<details><summary>‚úÖ Verify Installation</summary><br>

To confirm, run the command `brew -v`. The output should state `Homebrew 2.7.7` or higher.

If this is not the case, view the next section, _Common Errors_.

</details>

<details><summary>‚ùó Common Errors</summary><br>

It's highly unlikely that this will error out. Even when it's already installed, Homebrew will take the opportunity to install a clean version and update any outdated dependencies.

</details>

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>

Homebrew is a _package manager_, meaning, it provides software packages and can handle safe updating and uninstalling as needed. Homebrew is considered essential for core software which macOS doesn't ship natively, but which are necessary for your work. Homebrew packages are divided into **formulae**, **casks**, **taps**, or **bottles**; for the time being, we'll only be using formulae and casks.

_Formulae_ installations handle softwares that you'll only interact with through the terminal‚Äì¬†meaning, software that doesn't have an "App" interface in the GUI, such as Node. _Cask_ installations, on the other hand, are softwares that you interact with in your GUI, such as the Chrome internet browser.

In terminal, Homebrew utilizes the `brew` command prefix.

### Your Terminal Shell

#### Zsh<!-- omit in toc -->

> [Zsh Documentation] | [Zsh Users Project]

Zsh, pronounced by the acronym Z-S-H, is a Unix _shell_ and command interpreter for shell scripting. It serves as a replacement for _Bash_, the default Unix Terminal shell.
 
<details><summary>üìã Installation Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Copy and paste the following Homebrew command in your terminal.

```shell 
brew install zsh
```

If Zsh was successfully installed, you will see a large message that begins with `==> Installation successful!`.

**STEP 2.** Copy and paste the following script to make Zsh your default Terminal shell.

```shell
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
```

**STEP 3.** If prompted, enter your password.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember, as you type, your cursor will not move and your typing won't be visible‚Äì¬†simply type your full password and hit enter.

**STEP 4.** Quit your terminal application and restart it to open your Z shell. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You must "hard quit" Terminal‚Äì do not just close the window!

</details>

<details><summary>‚úÖ Verify Installation</summary><br>

To confirm installation, run the command `zsh --version`. The output should be `zsh 5.8` or higher.

To confirm Zsh has been made your default shell, run `echo $SHELL`. The output should be `bin/zsh`.

If this is not the case, view the next section, _Common Errors_.

</details>

<details><summary>‚ùó Common Errors</summary><br>

If Zsh is already installed, Homebrew will take the opportunity to upgrade any Brew packages before returning:

```shell
Warning: zsh <version> is already installed and up-to-date.
To reinstall <version>, run:
  brew reinstall zsh
```

If running `echo $SHELL` returned `bin/bash`, this means your default shell has not changed. First, try hard quitting your terminal. (Do not simply close the Terminal window. This doesn't quit the application. Use _command + Q_ to quit.) Once it has quit, reopen terminal and re-run `echo $SHELL`. This should fix the issue.

</details>

<br>

#### Oh My Zsh<!-- omit in toc -->

> [Oh My Zsh Documentation] | [Oh My Zsh Github] | [Oh My Zsh Issue Tickets]

Oh My Zsh is a community-driven framework for ZSH. It helps us customize and configure our shell.

<details><summary>üìã View Installation Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Copy and paste the following command in your terminal.

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If Oh My Zsh is successfully installed, you'll see a large message containing:

```shell
         __                                     __
  ____  / /_     ____ ___  __  __   ____  _____/ /_
 / __ \/ __ \   / __ `__ \/ / / /  /_  / / ___/ __ \
/ /_/ / / / /  / / / / / / /_/ /    / /_(__  ) / / /
\____/_/ /_/  /_/ /_/ /_/\__, /    /___/____/_/ /_/
                        /____/                       ....is now installed!
```

</details>

<details><summary>‚ùó Common Errors</summary><br>

It's highly rare that this step would error out; if you are receiving unexpected returns, visit the Oh My Zsh issue tickets on their GitHub, at the above link, and search for the text of your error message.

### Your Version Control Manager

<br>

#### Git<!-- omit in toc -->

> [Git Documentation] | [Git on Github]

_Git_ is a free, open-source _version control system_‚Äì meaning, it allows teams to collaborate on code that's stored safely in cloud‚Äì and comes with built-in tools for avoiding code conflicts.

<details><summary>üìã View Installation Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Run the following Homebrew command in your terminal:

```shell
brew install git
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Like before, any `brew` command may take an opportunity to upgrade Homebrew dependencies before actually installing the software you've requested‚Äì¬†that's all to say, don't worry if a lot seems to be happening when you run a `brew` command.

If successful, you should see multiple Brew installations (the dependencies for the Git software). 

</details>

<details><summary>‚úÖ Verify Installation</summary><br>

To confirm, run `git --version`. The output should be `git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)` or higher.

</details>

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>

Git version control is the lifeblood of the software engineer. It's nearly universally used on all projects and by all companies, because it's a lightweight, open-source, cloud-based approach to collaborative, conflict-free coding. Note, _Git_ is not the same as _GitHub_‚Äì Git is the _version control system_, whereas GitHub is one of many Git-based project hosting websites. (A comparable analogy is an _Img_ file and the _Imgur_ website‚Äì¬†Imgur hosts images, but an _Img_ and _Imgur_ are very different things.)

</details>

<details><summary>‚ùó Common Errors</summary><br>

It's highly rare that this step would error out; if you are receiving unexpected returns, visit the Git documentation, at the above link, and search for the text of your error message.

</details>

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>

For you to receive full "credit" for your work, your Git configuration includes your "author information", including your name and email address. Each time you make a commit to your Git repository, the commit includes this information on the commit details, and this enables GitHub to link and credit your commits to your GitHub profile.

By default, your authorship name is the name of your macOS user account, and the email is often that name at your "local" email‚Äì¬†for example, `misha@mishasmacbookpro.local`. Obviously, this needs to be updated.

</details>

<br>

#### Git Configurations<!-- omit in toc -->

We're not done just yet with Git‚Äì¬†in order for your computer to utilize your Git correctly, including communicating and syncing with your cloud-based Git repositories, it's highly important that we set up certain Git _configurations_ for your _global environment_.

<br>

##### Git Identity Information<!-- omit in toc -->

<details><summary>üìã View Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Run the following command, replacing the name and email address with your own information. (The email should correspond with your personal GitHub account.)

```shell
git config --global user.name "Misha Kessler"
git config --global user.email "misha.kessler@gmail.com"
```

</details>

<br>

##### Git Default Editor<!-- omit in toc -->

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>
  
Occasionally, Git will need to open documents in a code editor, or IDE. By default, the editor used is Vim, a rather confusing interface for novice software engineers. Instead, we'll tell Git to open in our default editor, VS Code. 

(Visual Studio does not need to be installed yet, in order to set up this configuration. We'll cover the installation later in this guide!)

</details>

<details><summary>üìã View Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Run the following command.

```shell
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

</details>

<br>

##### Git Branch Naming Convention<!-- omit in toc -->

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>
  
Git handles multiple versions of the same document by creating "branches," and software engineers have strong naming conventions and preferences for these branches. Previously, the main branch was called the `master` branch, but convention has moved away from this name due to its invocation of slavery and the language of oppression. 

Now, Git recommends replacing `master` with `main`, but we need to specifically tell our system to start all projects with this name.

</details>

<details><summary>üìã View Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Run the following command.

```shell
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

</details>

<br>

##### Git Rebase Convention<!-- omit in toc -->

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>
  
Rebasing in Git is a tool for integrating changes across versions. Rebasing is a "dangerous" git operation because it alters the Git history‚Äì¬†a cardinal sin, when used inappropriately‚Äì and occassionally, when dealing with complex git flow, you may be prompted to set your default "pull action." (Don't worry‚Äì you'll learn what all of this means soon enough.) Until you understand rebasing, we want to squash that warning by turning off automatic rebasing.

</details>

<details><summary>üìã View Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** Run the following command.

```shell
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

</details>

<br>

##### Git Security Token<!-- omit in toc -->

<details><summary>üîé Learn More</summary><br>

For you to have full control over your Git repositories from your Terminal, we need to set up your GitHub username and password, a security token, giving your Git-based commands the proper permissions to be executed, and GPG tools, allowing your commits to be verified locally.

</details>

<details><summary>üìã View Steps</summary><br>

**STEP 1.** 

</details>

<details><summary>‚úÖ Verify Configurations</summary><br>

To confirm these configurations are correct, run `git config`. The output should list all the information we've entered.
